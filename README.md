### Day 05 – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Introduction to OOP

Class as a blueprint

Object creation

Constructors (__init__)

No-argument constructor

Parameterized constructor

Multiple parameters in constructor

Instance Variables & Object Attributes

Class Variables (shared data)

Access via object and class name

Updating class attributes

Normal Methods

Defining and calling instance methods

Static Method (concept)

Real-life Class Examples

Student, Car, Company, College

Counting Objects using Class Attribute

Mutable vs Immutable Behavior in OOP Context

Four Pillars of OOP

Encapsulation

Abstraction

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Encapsulation

Private variables (__variable)

Getter and Setter methods

Bank & Account Examples

Hidden balance

Deposit & Withdraw logic

Secure data access using methods

👉 Focus of Day 05:
Understanding core OOP concepts, class design, data hiding, and implementing real-world logic using encapsulation 🧠🚀

### Day 6 – Python Practice

This notebook covers basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including:

Inheritance

Multiple Inheritance

super(),

public private protected

Diamond problem

Polymorphism

Reference
### Day 7 – OOPS Concepts (Brief)

Abstraction
Shows what to do and hides how to do.
Used to reduce complexity in large programs.

Abstract Class
Contains both implemented and non-implemented methods.
Child class completes the abstract methods.

Interface
Pure rule class with only method declarations.
All methods must be implemented by the child class.

Abstract Class vs Interface
Abstract class → partial implementation
Interface → only rules, no logic

Composition (HAS-A)
One class uses the object of another class.
Preferred when inheritance is not needed.

🛠 Mini Projects (OOPS – Python)
📚 1. Library Management System

Demonstrates Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation

LibraryItem → Parent class

Book, Magazine → Child classes (IS-A)

LibraryApp → Controller (HAS-A)

Different items calculate borrowing charges differently

Sample Output:

Item Type: Book → Borrow Days: 5 → Charge: 50

Item Type: Magazine → Borrow Days: 3 → Charge: 30

👨‍💼 2. Employee Payroll System

Demonstrates all 4 pillars of OOPS

Employee → Abstract class

FullTimeEmployee, PartTimeEmployee → Child classes

Salary → Encapsulated data

PayrollSystem → Controller (HAS-A)

Salary calculation differs based on employee type

Sample Output:

Employee Created → Salary: 500000

Employee Created → Salary: 40000

🏦 3. Bank Account Management System

Demonstrates Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism

BankAccount → Parent / abstract behavior

SavingAccount, CurrentAccount → Child classes

BankApp → Controller (HAS-A)

Interest calculation varies by account type

Key Features:

Deposit

Withdraw

Balance check

Interest calculation

✅ Summary

These mini projects helped in understanding:

Real-world use of OOPS concepts

IS-A and HAS-A relationships

Controller-based application design

Clean and reusable code structure
### Day 8 Python Practice 
Day 8 Practice:

### Day 10 Python Practice
This practice file demonstrates hands-on MySQL database operations using the MySQL command-line interface. It focuses on building a strong foundation in SQL basics and data analysis queries.

Key concepts covered:

Creating and managing databases and tables (CREATE, USE, DROP, TRUNCATE)

Inserting and retrieving data (INSERT, SELECT)

Filtering records using conditions (WHERE, AND, OR)

Sorting and limiting results (ORDER BY, LIMIT)

Aggregate functions:

AVG, SUM, COUNT, MAX, MIN

Grouping data for analysis (GROUP BY)

Using aliases for better readability

Performing real-world style queries on:

Student data

Candidates data

Employee data

Identifying and fixing SQL syntax errors

Analyzing data by department, city, gender, salary, and experience

Outcome:
This exercise strengthens practical SQL skills required for data analysis, backend development, and database management, with real-life table structures and queries.

### Day 11 Python Practice
Primary Key - Not null + unique
Not NULL -
Unique
Syntax for foreign jey - student_id REFERENCES
                           student(student_id)
INNER JOIN → A ∩ B | LEFT JOIN → A ∪ (A ∩ B) → A + A^B | RIGHT JOIN → B ∪ (A ∩ B) → B + A^B | FULL JOIN → A ∪ B
