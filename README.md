Polymorphism

Reference
### Day 7 – OOPS Concepts (Brief)

Abstraction
Shows what to do and hides how to do.
Used to reduce complexity in large programs.

Abstract Class
Contains both implemented and non-implemented methods.
Child class completes the abstract methods.

Interface
Pure rule class with only method declarations.
All methods must be implemented by the child class.

Abstract Class vs Interface
Abstract class → partial implementation
Interface → only rules, no logic

Composition (HAS-A)
One class uses the object of another class.
Preferred when inheritance is not needed.

🛠 Mini Projects (OOPS – Python)
📚 1. Library Management System

Demonstrates Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation

LibraryItem → Parent class

Book, Magazine → Child classes (IS-A)

LibraryApp → Controller (HAS-A)

Sample Output:

Item Type: Book → Borrow Days: 5 → Charge: 50

Item Type: Magazine → Borrow Days: 3 → Charge: 30

👨‍💼 2. Employee Payroll System

Employee Created → Salary: 500000

Employee Created → Salary: 40000

🏦 3. Bank Account Management System

### Day 10 Python Practice
This practice file demonstrates hands-on MySQL database operations using the MySQL command-line interface. It focuses on building a strong foundation in SQL basics and data analysis queries.

Key concepts covered:

Creating and managing databases and tables (CREATE, USE, DROP, TRUNCATE)

Inserting and retrieving data (INSERT, SELECT)

Filtering records using conditions (WHERE, AND, OR)

Sorting and limiting results (ORDER BY, LIMIT)

Aggregate functions:

AVG, SUM, COUNT, MAX, MIN

Grouping data for analysis (GROUP BY)

Using aliases for better readability

Performing real-world style queries on:

Student data

Candidates data

Employee data

Identifying and fixing SQL syntax errors

Analyzing data by department, city, gender, salary, and experience

Outcome:
This exercise strengthens practical SQL skills required for data analysis, backend development, and database management, with real-life table structures and queries.

### Day 11 Python Practice
Primary Key - Not null + unique
Not NULL -
Unique
Syntax for foreign jey - student_id REFERENCES
                           student(student_id)
INNER JOIN → A ∩ B | LEFT JOIN → A ∪ (A ∩ B) → A + A^B | RIGHT JOIN → B ∪ (A ∩ B) → B + A^B | FULL JOIN → A ∪ B
### Day 12 Python Practice
A subquery is a query inside another query, used when one question depends on the result of another.

Transaction (All or Nothing)
A transaction is a sequence of SQL operations executed as a single unit where either all changes are committed or all are rolled back.
It starts with a transaction, executes multiple SQL statements, and ends with either commit or rollback.

Indexing
Indexing helps SQL find data faster, similar to a book index or page number.
Without an index, the database scans every row from beginning to end, which is slow.
With an index, the database directly jumps to the required data, which is fast.

SQL Commands Are Divided Into Five Types

Data Definition Language (DDL) – Structure (Design)
CREATE, ALTER, DROP, RENAME, TRUNCATE

Data Manipulation Language (DML) – Data (Rows)
INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

Data Query Language (DQL) – Fetch Data
SELECT

Data Control Language (DCL) – Security
GRANT, REVOKE

Transaction Control Language (TCL) – Transactions
SAVEPOINT, COMMIT, ROLLBACK

Normalization
Normalization is the process of converting a messy and unorganized table into clean, well-structured tables.

Why Normalization?
Reduces data duplication
Avoids insert anomaly
### Day 13 Python Practice
TYPES OF NORMALIZATION:
1. 1NF-> ONE CELL SHOULD NOT HAVE MORE THAN ONE VALUE
      -> ATOMIC VALUES
      -> DEFINITION --> EACH COLUMN SHOULD CONTAIN ATOMIC (SINGLE) VALUE

2. 2NF-> TABLE MUST BE 1NF
      -> NO PARTIAL DEPENDENCY

3. 3NF-> TABLE MUST BE 2NF
      -> NOT DEPENDENT ON ANOTHER ROW WHICH IS ALREADY DEPENDENT ON ANY OTHER ROW
      -> NO TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCY
SQLite: IT IS A LIGHTWEIGHT DATABASE THAT STORES DATA IN A SINGLE FILE AND IS INBUILT IN PYTHON


COMMANDS IN SQLite:

connect()--> OPENS DATABASE
cursor()--> RUNS SQL
execute()--> EXECUTES SQL
commit()--> SAVE CHANGES
close()--> CLOSES CONNECTION
Avoids update anomaly
Avoids delete anomaly
